- This web site uses data from iNaturalist, one of the world's best nature apps for connecting scientists, naturalists, and anyone with an interest in how the natural world works: This data is to create a virtual nature walk, highlighting plants, animals, insects, and more near Seneca Newnham Campus.

- Filtering All species/Only Native Species/Only Introduced Species.
- Worked with dynamic web pages using real data.
